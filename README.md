# batchSVG
Converts Bitmap images to SVG using matplotlib. Works best with PNG Images. Its hilarious how easy this turned out to be.

Clone the repo and empty the input and output folders. Add PNG/JPG images to the input folder. Ensure there aren't multiple dots "." in the filenames.

I tried everything from obscure Py2 libraries to Adobe PS automation, until I stumbled across a YouTube video in which the narrator was exporting Seaborn plots to SVG. This is even simpler!
